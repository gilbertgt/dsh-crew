// T-110 DoD items 1 and 2: the `### Changed` block of the unreleased section
// tells the user, in their own words, that a question can now be left undecided
// and that "not in scope" is now a short list of things with a real cost.
//
// What it proves: the one file a user reads to find out what changed says what
// changed. This job nearly shipped without it — none of the first sixteen DoD
// items named `CHANGELOG.md`, and no task owned the file, while the READMEs were
// being edited to tell users about a new option they now have. A change the user
// is told about everywhere except the change log is a change they find by
// accident.
//
// WHY THE ANCHORS ARE CONCEPTS AND NOT SENTENCES. DoD item 6 requires this
// section to be written in the user's language and NOT to copy the authoritative
// paragraphs. So a case pinning the canonical wording here would be pinning the
// exact thing the DoD forbids. Every check below names a thing that must be SAID;
// none of them dictates how. The two strings the DoD itself gives — `leave it
// undecided`, and `not in scope` with `real cost` — are pinned as given.
//
// What it does NOT prove: that the entry reads well, or that a user would
// understand it. That is DoD item 6 and it belongs to a doc reviewer.
//
// PINNING STYLE: FLATTENED (the entries are wrapped prose) and sliced to the
// `### Changed` block of the entry that GRANTS the option — located by that
// promise, not by position. It was the top section when this case was written and
// a later release legitimately sits above it; pinning "the first `## `" would then
// check a release note that never mentioned this change. An entry under 0.9.0
// describes a version that already shipped and still cannot answer for this one,
// because only the entry carrying the promise is read.
