// T-110 DoD item 3: the change log says out loud that none of this loosens the
// change-request rule — if saying yes to a later ask would move the milestone
// list, a DoD item or the scope, the PM still writes the change request and still
// asks the user first.
//
// What it proves: the qualifier reached the audience most likely to over-read the
// headline. "You can leave questions undecided and ask later, free" is a sentence
// a user will remember, and the one place they meet it without any surrounding
// context is the change log. Every other carrier of this rule — `roles/pm.md`,
// `principles.md`, `CLAUDE.md` — states the limit next to the exemption, because
// this job decided the guard sits UPSTREAM of principle 14 and does not relax it.
// A change log that dropped the limit would be the only document in the set
// promising something the crew will not do, and the user would meet the
// difference as a broken promise.
//
// What it does NOT prove: that a user reads the qualifier, or that a PM honours
// it on a real request.
//
// PINNING STYLE: FLATTENED, sliced to the `### Changed` block of the top section.
// The limit must be in the same block as the promise: a caveat under a different
// heading is a caveat nobody reaches.
